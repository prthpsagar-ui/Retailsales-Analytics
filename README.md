Retail Sales Analytics Project

Project Overview:

This project analyzes a retail store’s sales dataset to evaluate business performance, revenue trends, and product profitability. The objective was to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights using:

- SQL for data analysis and KPI calculation  
- Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization  

This is a complete end-to-end data analytics project covering querying, transformation, KPI development, and dashboard creation.

Problem Statement:

The business wanted to analyze sales performance to answer key questions:

- What is the total revenue and profit generated?
- How many orders and products were sold?
- Which product categories and regions perform best?
- What are the monthly sales trends?
- Which products are top and bottom performers?

The analysis supports data-driven decision-making and business growth.

Dataset Description:

The dataset contains retail transactional data including:

- Order ID  
- Order Date  
- Customer Details  
- Product Category & Sub-Category  
- Region  
- Sales  
- Quantity  
- Profit

Project Workflow-

SQL Data Analysis;

The project began with SQL-based analysis of the raw dataset.

Tasks Performed:

- Created database and imported tables  
- Explored dataset structure and validated records  
- Used `GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`  
- Wrote subqueries for deeper analysis  
- Calculated key KPIs:
  - Total Revenue  
  - Total Profit  
  - Total Orders  
  - Total Quantity Sold  
- Analyzed:
  - Monthly sales trends  
  - Region-wise performance  
  - Category-wise distribution  
- Identified:
  - Top 5 products by revenue and profit  
  - Bottom 5 performing products  

---

Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python);

After SQL analysis, Python was used for preprocessing and validation.

Tasks Performed:

- Handled missing values  
- Removed duplicate records  
- Standardized column names  
- Converted date columns to datetime format  
- Created calculated columns:
  - Month  
  - Year  
  - Profit Margin (%)  
- Performed data validation checks  
- Exported cleaned dataset for visualization

Power BI Dashboard;

Finally, an interactive dashboard was built in Power BI.

Dashboard Features:

- KPI Cards:
  - Total Revenue  
  - Total Profit  
  - Total Orders  
  - Average Order Value (AOV)  
  - Profit Margin (%)  
- Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)  
- Sales by Category and Region (Bar Chart)  
- Profit Analysis  
- Top & Bottom Products  
- Slicers for dynamic filtering  

---

Key KPIs-

- Total Revenue  
- Total Profit  
- Total Orders  
- Total Quantity Sold  
- Average Order Value (AOV)  
- Profit Margin (%)  

---

Business Value Created;

This project enables the business to:

- Identify high-performing products  
- Understand sales trends and seasonality  
- Improve inventory planning  
- Optimize pricing strategies  
- Make region-based strategic decisions  
- Increase overall profitability  

---

Key Insights;

- A small percentage of products contribute to most revenue  
- Certain regions generate higher profit margins  
- Sales follow consistent monthly growth patterns  
- Some products generate high sales but lower profit margins  

---

Outcomes;

Through this project, I:

- Strengthened my ability to write real-world SQL queries  
- Improved data cleaning and preprocessing skills using Python  
- Gained hands-on experience building interactive Power BI dashboards  
- Developed business-focused KPI analysis skills  
- Learned how to convert raw data into actionable insights  
- Enhanced my ability to communicate data-driven findings effectively  

---

Tools & Technologies Used;

- SQL  
- Python (Pandas)  
- Power BI  
- Excel  

---

Conclusion;

This project demonstrates practical end-to-end data analytics skills — from SQL querying and Python-based data cleaning to building professional Power BI dashboards that generate actionable business insights.
