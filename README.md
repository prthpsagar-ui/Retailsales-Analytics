# 🛒 Retail Sales Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a retail store’s sales dataset to evaluate business performance, revenue trends, and product profitability. The objective was to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights using:

- SQL for data analysis and KPI calculation  
- Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization  

This is a complete end-to-end data analytics project covering querying, transformation, KPI development, and dashboard creation.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The business wanted to analyze sales performance to answer key questions:

- What is the total revenue and profit generated?
- How many orders and products were sold?
- Which product categories and regions perform best?
- What are the monthly sales trends?
- Which products are top and bottom performers?

The analysis supports data-driven decision-making and business growth.

# 🔄 Project Workflow

## 1️⃣ SQL Data Analysis

The project began with SQL-based analysis of the raw dataset.

### Tasks Performed:

- Created database and imported tables  
- Explored dataset structure and validated records  
- Used `GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`  
- Wrote subqueries for deeper analysis  
- Calculated key KPIs:
  - Total Revenue  
  - Total Profit  
  - Total Orders  
  - Total Quantity Sold  
- Analyzed:
  - Monthly sales trends  
  - Region-wise performance  
  - Category-wise distribution  
- Identified:
  - Top 5 products by revenue and profit  
  - Bottom 5 performing products

## 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python)

After SQL analysis, Python was used for preprocessing and validation.

### Tasks Performed:

- Handled missing values  
- Removed duplicate records  
- Standardized column names  
- Converted date columns to datetime format  
- Created calculated columns:
  - Month  
  - Year  
  - Profit Margin (%)  
- Performed data validation checks  
- Exported cleaned dataset for visualization

## 3️⃣ Power BI Dashboard Development

Finally, an interactive dashboard was built in Power BI.

### Dashboard Features:

- KPI Cards:
  - Total Revenue  
  - Total Profit  
  - Total Orders  
  - Average Order Value (AOV)  
  - Profit Margin (%)  
- Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)  
- Sales by Category and Region (Bar Chart)  
- Profit Analysis  
- Top & Bottom Products  
- Slicers for dynamic filtering
