Project Overview;
This project simulates a real-world retail sales analytics workflow using intentionally messy data. The dataset includes missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and mixed date types to demonstrate practical data cleaning and analytical skills.
The goal is to transform raw, unreliable data into meaningful business insights using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

Objectives:
Clean and validate messy retail sales data,
Apply structured SQL transformations,
Perform advanced processing using Python,
Create an interactive dashboard in Power BI,
Demonstrate an end-to-end analytics pipeline.

Tools & Technologies;
SQL Server → Data cleaning & validation,
Python (Pandas) → Transformation & feature engineering,
Power BI → Visualization & business insights,
Excel → Raw dataset simulation.

Dataset Characteristics;
The dataset intentionally includes:
Missing numeric values,
Blank date fields,
Duplicate records,
Inconsistent text formatting,
Mixed date structures,
This simulates real operational business data.

Workflow;
  SQL — Data Cleaning;
Imported messy Excel dataset,
Handled NULL values,
Removed duplicates,
Standardized text fields,
Validated analytical integrity,
Output → Structured dataset.

  Python — Advanced Processing;
Removed residual inconsistencies,
Converted date formats,
Filled missing values,
Created revenue feature,
Automated validation,
Output → Analysis-ready dataset.

  Power BI — Visualization;
KPI dashboard creation,
Regional performance analysis,
Product/category insights,
Time-based revenue trends,
Interactive filters.

  Key Insights;
Regional revenue comparison,
High-performing products,
Sales trends over time,
Category contribution analysis,
Business performance indicators.

 Skills Demonstrated;
Data cleaning & validation,
SQL analytical querying,
Python transformation,
Feature engineering,
Dashboard storytelling,
End-to-end workflow thinking.

 Outcome;
This project demonstrates the ability to handle imperfect real-world data and convert it into decision-ready insights through a structured analytics pipeline.
